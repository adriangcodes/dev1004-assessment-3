# Base Image: node:22-slim
# 
# Uses official Node.js image, version 22, using a lightweight version of Linux
# 'slim' variant means it's Debian-based but stripped down (smaller size)
#   - Good balance of functionality and attack surface
#   - Smaller than 'node:22' (full image), but more flexible than alpine
# Still includes essential build tools (unlike alpine which may require workarounds)
# Maintained by Node.js and Docker Library maintainers â€” trusted source, stable and secure
FROM node:22-slim
